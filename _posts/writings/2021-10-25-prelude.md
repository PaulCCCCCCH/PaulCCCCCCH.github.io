Finally found a chance to get this thing done: set up a formal version of my website and publish it.

I have tried this multiple times over the years. I have designed and built up my own theme and wrote all the scripts with detailed docs. But as soon as I finished building the pipeline, I realized there wasn't much I wanted to share with people after all. In some sense, it was the process of building the website that I enjoyed, not maintaining it or creating content. I do takes notes and write things (**a lot**), but I was not so comfortable sharing them.

Yet, this time, I feel the urge that I need a place to demonstrate myself. Making up my mind really makes a significant difference: the website was ready in just 2 hours, because the purpose has changed from building it on my own to rapidly creating a space for exposure (and that I'm now at CMU, which means every minute I spent on this came from my sleep time).

Anyway, I will start migrating my content to this website (either public or private) as much as I can. See you in the future!
